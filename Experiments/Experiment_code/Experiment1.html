        <p>This Experiment was used as a layout for making my homepage on 20th January 2014.</p> 
        <p>I have used css and html to implement this Experiment.</p>
        <p>I implemented this experiment to clear my basics about css and html.</p>
        <p>In this experiment I explored the css propreties like :
            <ul>
            <li>Absolute:
                <p>It specifies the positioning method for an element. I was having trouble with the layout and absolute solved those problems.</p></li>
            <li>Margin:
                <p>It clears an area around the element. It helps element to avoid overlapping each other.</p></li>
            <li>Class and Id:
                <p>Understood how Class and id selectors work. They help to give a particular class or a particular element custom modification.</p></li>
            </ul>
            </p>
