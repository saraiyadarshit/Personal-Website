                    I would like to thank the faculty and the staff for this wonderful course where I have learned as well as enjoyed a lot.

                <p class="sub_heading">Professor Dr.Richard Rasala</p>
                <p class="normal_text">
                   I would like to thank Prof. Rasala for this amazing course of Web Development. He has given me a one of the best learning experience and motivation
                     throughout the course through his lectures. He taught us excellent techniques of Web development through which I have developed qualities to be 
                    a professional Web Developer. In his lectures, he had implementation for every topic he taught in class which really helped understanding the
                    concepts and fundamentals. Also, when I emailed him with doubts he would reply back with the best explanation which always cleared my doubts. Personally,
                     I think he is the most organized person I have ever met in my life. He used to convey this message to us in almost every lecture which I feel everyone should apply
                     in their life "Be Sincere. Work Hard. Have Fun. Make History!!"

                <p class="sub_heading">Professor Jose Annunziato</p>
                <p class="normal_text">
                    I would also like to thank Prof. Jose Annunziato. He has very well documented experiments on API. He had taken a class on Rotten Tomatoes API where he 
                    showed us live implementation of his experiment. This was one of the best lectures I had attended in my life, literally speaking. He taught us eveything from basics
                    to advanced level of implementation in one lecture without ever going fast. After that lecture I had a new self confidence in me that yes, I can too implement this
                     in my project. Thank You.

                    Yitao Xiong is my TA. I would like to say he is the best TA I have ever got. His weekly review were always detailed and informative. He always used to motivate me. 
                    Whenever I went to his TA hours he use to always try his best to clear my doubts. I wish him all the best.

                    I would like to thank Ketki Gandhe, one of the best person I have ever met. She is very down to earth. I use to go to her TA sessions on every Thursday. I
                 learnt the technique of parsing data in JSONP format from her. She also gave me important tips to improve my performance in this course. I would like to wish
                 her all the best for her future.
