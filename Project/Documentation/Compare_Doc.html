                    The user can navigate to this page by using the Navigation bar.<br />
                    The Link to this Page can be found <a target="_blank" href="../project_code/Compare.html">here</a>

                <p class="sub_heading">Functionalities provided by this Page</p>
                <p class="normal_text">
                   On this page the users can compare any two movies of their choice by giving an input in the compare bar and clicking the compare button. 
                    On Clicking the title or the poster of the movie the user is directed to a page where the specific movie details are displayed.
                   Also the user can navigate to any part of website from this page.
                </p>

                <p class="sub_heading">Detalis about Implementation:</p>
                <p class="normal_text">A function call is made on this page when the user clicks the compare button. There are two functions to display the details of both the movies.
                     In each function the value of the textbox is stored in a variable and I use this variable as a parameter while making the call to the API. 
                     I make two API calls to Rotten Tomatoes API in each function where I request the data in JSONP format, a technique taught by Professor Jose Annunziato.
                     I use JavaScript to parse the data which I receive. I use JQUERY's id and class selectors to encapsulate the data in HTML format, i.e. I am
                     dynamically displaying the data. I am displaying the details of this page in a table. When the page is refreshed,
                    the table becomes empty and a new API call is made which returns the same or different data based on the Rotten Tomatoes API.<br /><br />
                    I have also used validation i.e. when the user query is null or undefined it gives a message to enter a valid movie name.

                <p class="sub_heading">Why is this page Unique</p>
                <p class="normal_text">
                   This page is unique because no other website has the functionality to compare movies.
                </p>

                <p class="sub_heading">Why is I invented this Functionality</p>
                <p class="normal_text">
                   As you may know comparing movies is a little new. I as a movie fan sometimes cannot decide which movie should I 
                    buy on DVD or should watch in theaters. To simplify this difficult choice I made this functionality so that 
                    movie fans can directly compare the movies on this site and decide for themselves which movie should they buy on DVD or
                    watch in Theaters based on the results.
                </p>

          
                <p class="sub_heading">Challenges Faced</p>
                <p class="normal_text">
                   The most difficult challenge I faced was how to send a unique information about a movie to other page so that it can display the specific details about the
                    movie on MovieInformation.aspx page. I solved the problem by appending the id of the movie on the url and using a function on MovieInformation.aspx page to 
                    extract the id from the url.<br /><br />
                    The other challenge was displaying the data dynamically. I had to learn Javascript and JQUERY fundamentals to acheive this. I love learning new technologies. I learnt Javascript and JQUERY using 
                    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools</a>. Also, Professor Rasala's and Jose Annunziato's experiments helped me a lot.
                </p>

                <p class="sub_heading">Other Details</p>
                <p class="normal_text">
                   Other cool features in this page is the hover effects on the movie sections. If the user brings the mouse over one of the posters
                   of the movie sections the poster changes its opacity. This gives the posters a different aesthetic look. Also, when the user brings the 
                   mouse over the title of the movies it changes its color which brings same aesthetic effect on the site.
                   Both the posters and titles act like a link. Once clicked the user is redirected to a new page which gives the details about that particular movie.
