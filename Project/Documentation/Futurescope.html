                   The current search and compare functionality does not give suggestions while typing in the input field. This can be improved in the future by giving
                    suggestions of the movies.

                   Currently the website is not suitable to view on cell phones or tablet, but this can be improved by making the website mobile and tablet 
                    compatible. However the website has a fluid layout.

                   If and when the rotten tomatoes API give more information from their API like information about Actors, TV shows there is a scope for future extension and
                    enhancement of the project.<br /><br />
                    We can display Actor information as well as information about TV Shows like specific details, Top TV shows, Newly released TV shows, Popular TV shows and
                     Upcoming TV shows.
