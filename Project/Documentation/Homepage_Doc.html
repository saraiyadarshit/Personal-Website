                   This page displays the Movies currently playing in theaters, Popular Movies and Upcoming Movies. On Clicking the poster of the movie the user is directed to a page where the specific movie details are displayed.
                    Also the user can navigate to any part of website from this page.
                </p>

                <p class="sub_heading">Detalis about Implementation:</p>
                <p class="normal_text">On loading this page a function call is made to load the data in the page. Three function calls are made for Movies currently playing in theaters, 
                    Popular Movies and Upcoming Movies. In each function I make an API call to Rotten Tomatoes API where 
                    I request the data in JSONP format, a technique taught by Professor Jose Annunziato. I use JavaScript to parse the data which I receive. I use JQUERY's id and class
                    selectors to encapsulate the data in HTML format, i.e. I am dynamically displaying the data. Also, I am only displaying the first five movies from the data I receive.
                    I am only displaying five movies because it is a home page and I wanted to make it neat and concise. I have given links for users to see the complete list of movies.
                    I am displaying the details of this page in three divs. When the page is refreshed,
                    the divs becomes empty and a new API call is made for each function which returns the same or different data based on the Rotten Tomatoes API.

                <p class="sub_heading">Why Have I not asked for User Details</p>
                <p class="normal_text">
                   This is just an Informative website hence I have opted out from asking for users to register or give any details. Also, I wanted for all users to have equal 
                    and unrestricted access throughout the website.

                <p class="sub_heading">Challenges Faced</p>
                <p class="normal_text">
                   The most difficult challenge I faced was how to send a unique information about a movie to other page so that it can display the specific details about the
                    movie on MovieInformation.aspx page. I solved the problem by appending the id of the movie on the url and using a function on MovieInformation.aspx page to 
                    extract the id from the url.<br /><br />
                    The other challenge was displaying the movie posters without using table because professor Rasala had mentioned that we cannot use tables just for the purpose
                    of layout. I solved this challenge using an innovative yet simple approach. I am displaying the posters inline in the div and separating the posters with a simple empty string.
                    While progressing on my project I came to know about a property "hspace" which would create some spacing between the posters. But I have not used "hspace" as I like my simple 
                    empty string solution much better.<br /><br />
                    The other challenge was displaying the data dynamically. I had to learn Javascript and JQUERY fundamentals to acheive this. I love learning new technologies. I learnt Javascript and JQUERY using 
                    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools</a>. Also, Professor Rasala's and Jose Annunziato's experiments helped me a lot.

                <p class="sub_heading">Other Details</p>
                <p class="normal_text">
                   Other cool features in this page is the hover effects on the movie sections. If the user brings the mouse over one of the posters
                   of the movie sections the poster changes its opacity. This gives the posters a quite a different aesthetic feel.
                   The posters act like a link. Once clicked the user is redirected to a new page which gives the details about that particular movie.
