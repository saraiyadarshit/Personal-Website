                <p class="normal_text">
                   This page displays specific movie details of a particular movie which is selected by the user.
                    Also the user can navigate to any part of website from this page.

                <p class="sub_heading">Detalis about Implementation:</p>
                <p class="normal_text">
                    On loading this page a function call is made to a function "onpageload()". I have written a code which helps me to extract the URL from
                    the address bar and extract the unique movie ID which is appended to the URL. The function then makes an API call to Rotten Tomatoes API where 
                    I request the data in JSONP format, a technique taught by Professor Jose Annunziato. I use JavaScript to parse the data which I receive. 
                    I use JQUERY's id and class selectors to encapsulate the data in HTML format, i.e. I am dynamically displaying the data. Then anther function 
                    is called to display similar movies which uses similar steps to display the data. I am displaying the data in divs and when the page is refreshed,
                    the divs become empty and a new API call is made which returns the same or different data based on the Rotten Tomatoes API.

                <p class="sub_heading">Challenges Faced</p>
                <p class="normal_text">
                   The most difficult challenge was displaying the movie information without using table because professor Rasala had mentioned that we cannot use tables just for the purpose
                    of layout. I solved this challenge using JavaScript and JQUERY.<br /><br />
                    The other challenge was displaying the cast and crew in a sliding panel. I performed a successful experiment on the same functionality but when I implemented it
                    on this page it did not work as I had expected. I went on to write some new code so that my website did not break when there was no cast information provided in
                     the data received from the Rotten Tomatoes API.
                    The other challenge was displaying the data dynamically. I had to learn Javascript and JQUERY fundamentals to acheive this. I love learning new technologies. I learnt Javascript and JQUERY using 
                    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools</a>. Also, Professor Rasala's and Jose Annunziato's experiments helped me a lot.

                <p class="sub_heading">Other Details</p>
                <p class="normal_text">
                   Other cool features in this page is the hover effects on the movie sections. If the user brings the mouse over one of the posters
                   of the movie sections the poster changes its opacity. This gives the posters a different aesthetic look. Also, when the user brings the 
                   mouse over the title of the movies it changes its color which brings same aesthetic effect on the site.
                   Both the posters and titles act like a link. Once clicked the user is redirected to a new page which gives the details about that particular movie.
