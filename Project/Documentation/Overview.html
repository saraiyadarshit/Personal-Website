                    This page gives an Overview over my entire project on MovieCentral which was developed as a part of Web Development course CS5610 under Professor Dr.Richard Rasala.<br />
                    The Link to my project can be found <a target="_blank" href="../project_code/Default.aspx">here</a>

                <p class="sub_heading">Objective behind Movie Central</p>
                <p class="normal_text">
                    The Objective of MovieCentral is to give Movie Fans an unrestricted access to browse through myriad movies and find a movie they can watch. It is the Holy Grail which the Movie lovers were finding.
                    The users can search any hollywood or bollywood movies. They can also get a list of all the popular movies, movies currently playing in theaters and upcoming movies. 
                    They can also browse through movies which have currently been released on Dvds, Popular movies on Dvds and also the top rented movies on Dvds. 
                    The users can select a particular movie and browse through the movie information. They can also search for their favorite movies on this site. 
                    The users can also compare two movies using the compare functionality provided in this website.
                    </p>

                <p class="sub_heading">Why I chose this Project</p>
                <p class="normal_text">
                    On my very first lecture, Professor Rasala said that do a project which you are interested in. I love web development and I also have an interest to watch different types of movies. 
                    You can say that I am a Movie fan. I had a productive discussion with profesor Rasala when I decided that I willmake an Informative website about Movies.
                    And hence, I decided to make <a target="_blank" href="../project_code/Default.aspx">MovieCentral</a> in which users can browse through the movies comfortably. 
                    By comfortably, I mean that the users do not need to create any account they can just browse through endlessly without any ads popping up.
