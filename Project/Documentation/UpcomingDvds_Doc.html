                <p class="normal_text">
                   This page displays all the Upcoming Movies being released on DVDs. On Clicking the title or the poster of the movie the user is directed to a page where the specific movie details are displayed.
                    Also the user can navigate to any part of website from this page.

                <p class="sub_heading">Detalis about Implementation:</p>
                <p class="normal_text">On loading this page a function call is made to load the data in the page. First, I make an API call to Rotten Tomatoes API where 
                    I request the data in JSONP format, a technique taught by Professor Jose Annunziato. I use JavaScript to parse the data which I receive. I use JQUERY's id and class
                    selectors to encapsulate the data in HTML format, i.e. I am dynamically displaying the data. I am displaying the details of this page in a table. When the page is refreshed,
                    the table becomes empty and a new API call is made which returns the same or different data based on the Rotten Tomatoes API.

                <p class="sub_heading">Challenges Faced</p>
                <p class="normal_text">
                   The most difficult challenge I faced was how to send a unique information about a movie to other page so that it can display the specific details about the
                    movie on MovieInformation.aspx page. I solved the problem by appending the id of the movie on the url and using a function on MovieInformation.aspx page to 
                    extract the id from the url.<br /><br />
                    The other challenge was displaying the data dynamically. I had to learn Javascript and JQUERY fundamentals to acheive this. I love learning new technologies. I learnt Javascript and JQUERY using 
                    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools</a>. Also, Professor Rasala's and Jose Annunziato's experiments helped me a lot.

                <p class="sub_heading">Other Details</p>
                <p class="normal_text">
                   Other cool features in this page is the hover effects on the movie sections. If the user brings the mouse over one of the posters
                   of the movie sections the poster changes its opacity. This gives the posters a different aesthetic look. Also, when the user brings the 
                   mouse over the title of the movies it changes its color which brings same aesthetic effect on the site.
                   Both the posters and titles act like a link. Once clicked the user is redirected to a new page which gives the details about that particular movie.
