<h3>My First Blog</h3>

<p>
After the first class I was very excited to start developing my home page as soon as possible. I started my first week studying HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript from W3Schools. I got a brief idea about the languages.

<p>
I started developing my homepage and was making good progress. Then I encoutered a lot of problems with the layout of the web page. I just could not get the elements positioned where I wanted them to be. Still, I managed somehow and positioned the elements.

<p>
But, Anju and Ketki (TAs :) ) pointed out that, I had hardcoded the pixel values which is not a good practise in web development. Repositioning the elements was not a good experience and I was not able to do it.

  So, I think my first experiment will be on layout of a webpage which will hopefully clear my basic concepts on css and html.
