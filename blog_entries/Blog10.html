<h3>Blog No.10</h3>
<p>I just noticed that I skiped last week's blog.</p>
<p>Last week I implemented the feedback form with an email feature which is more user friendly. I improved my experiment 8.</p>
<p>In this experiment I have use ASP.net mailMessage object to send a mail. It creates a mail object with subject, body and recipient which it sends using SMTP server.</p>
<p>I tried using yahoo's SMTP server but I failed to find specific instructions like server name and port number to use it in my application</p>
<p>I switched to google, where they have excellent documentation of how to use their SMTP server.</p>
<p>I have created a google account with username: cs5610neu@gmail.com and password: Spr2014ing, this is the account my application uses to send emails.</p>
