<h3>Blog No.11</h3>

<p>This week I realized that my homepage is not at all responsive. I had a fixed image as a background which is not a good practise.</p>
<p>I completely changed my homepage which is now responsive and looks professional. I would really like to thank Ajay Pandit for giving giving me the tips and motivation to completely change my homepage.</p>
<p>This week I will also start testing The Movie Database API, which I will use for my final project.</p>
