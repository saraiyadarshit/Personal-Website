<h3>Blog No.15</h3>

<p>
    This will be my last blog.
</p>

<p>
    I have immensely enjoyed the web development course. I will be missing doing weekly experiments and especially the reviews from Yitao.
</p>

<p>
    I will also miss the TA sessions of thursday with Ketki Gandhe in which I use to learn and enjoy a lot at the same time.
</p>

<p>
    I would like to thank Prof. Richard Rasala and Prof. Jose Annunziato for this wonderful course.
</p>
<p>
    I would also like to thank my wonderful TAs Yitao Xing and Ketki Gandhe for helping me throughout this course. I wish you all the best for your future.

<p>
    Thank You. Bye!!
