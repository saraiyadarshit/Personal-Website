<h3>My Second Blog</h3>

<p>
Based on my first experiment I started designing my homepage from scratch and at one time it was looking good but as soon as I uploaded it to server the layout was not in synchronization.
</p>

<p>
Then I tried solving the problem but it didnt work instead my layout on my local machine too got distorted.</p>

<p>
At this point now I am looking for a solution to my problem and thinking about what my next experiment will be on.</p>

<p>
I am very curious about Javascript and Jquery so I think my next experiment will be on that topic</p>
