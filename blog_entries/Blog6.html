<h3>Blog No.6</h3>

<p> Found a really interesting topic yesterday on Accordian. I found it interesting and the best thing is implementing accordian is very simple. 
    It not only induces user interactiveness into the website but also makes optimal usage of space to display many elements.</p>
<p>
    Hence, for the next experiment I will implement an Accordian and will try to use it on my homepage.
