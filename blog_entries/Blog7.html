<h3>Blog No.7</h3>

<p> In this week I focussed on Javascript, I found it to be very interesting, robust and easy to implement.</p>
<p>
    Hence, for the next experiment I will focus on Javascript and choose a experiment which will be useful to me in my project. I will implemet a new registration page for a new member which will use javascript for validation. 
    I will use this experiment in my project to register new members.
