<h3>Blog No.8</h3>

<p> This week I learned more about javascript.</p>
<p>
    I had started an experiment on displaying weather using yahoo apis but I failed to implement it. I will clear the doubts during TA hours.

<p>
    I really like the inputs my TA Yitao provides every week and they really help me a lot. So, I thought of making his job a little easier by making a feedback form on my webpage.
</p>
<p>But unfortunately the current implementation of feedback page works but it is not user friendly.</p>
